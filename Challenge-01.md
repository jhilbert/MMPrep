Part 1
======
Watch “Foundations of Programming: Fundamentals” at Lynda.com and then answer
the following questions:

1. Imagine asking a friend to meet you at a restaurant. What instructions would 
   a computer program need that your friend would not in order to understand how
   to get there?
   
   A computer requires step-by-step very specific instructions how to get there. Depending on the language of choice, instructions may look different, but conceptually it could look like this:
   Move 5 miles
   Turn left
   Move 3 miles
   Turn right
   Move 1 mile
   Turn left
   Enter 2nd door

2. What is the difference between source code and machine code? What does the
   CPU do? Where are instructions and data stored?
   
   Source code is human readable, and must be translated into machine code.
   Machine code is executable by a CPU, basically lowest level of instructions that a CPU is working with. Each CPU has a different set of machine instructions, hence to execute a program, it is important to compile or interpret it into the right machine code.
   A CPU can process a set of machine instructions, and it leverages access to storage/memory.
   Basically all instructions and data are stored in memory.

3. What is an IDE and why is it useful?

Integrated Development Environment, like XCode, Eclipse, or Visual Studio
Set of tools to support a developer to write, compile, test, and manage source code

4. What kind of a language is Objective-C? Why do you think we use it for making
   device specific applications? Why wouldn't we want to use an interpreted
   language for making iPhone and iPad apps?
   
   Compiled language
   Faster execution, no need for an interpreter
